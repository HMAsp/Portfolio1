              Hello there! I'm Hans. <br />I embarked on an exciting journey of
              learning and creativity at the age of 40. With this website I
              intend to give you a little insight to who I am and show you some
              of the work I have done over my first year as a front-end
              development student.

              The cross course assignment is my first ever design and
              introduction to HTML and CSS. This project opened my eyes to many
              things regarding WCAG and SEO that I had never learned about until
              we started this learning trip. It started as a pure design
              assignment. After that we had to develop our designs using vanilla
              HTML and CSS and in the second semester when we started learning
              Javascript, this site was rewritten to fetch its products via an
              API. For the API we used wordpress and we set this up ourselves to
              become an ecommerce build.

              This would be my semester project. This project put together all
              the things we learned throughout our first semester. It is more
              word and text oriented so it was a challenge as the first one we
              made was mostly images and therefore easier to work with in a way.
              The design is mine and even though I am a very dark theme biased
              person I want to make this a bit more bright and vibrant because
              the target age group was 7-15. This project is also designed and
              developed using Figma, HTML & CSS.

              The second semester started with a bang and we were thrown in to
              the world of Javascript. This assignment shows my first time ever
              working with JS. The task was to create a simple site and showcase
              that we could handle API data. Product list and a dynamically
              generated detail page.

              To conclude our first year journey we had the project exam. This
              travelblog binds it all together and showcases my acquired skills
              in design, development and programming. This project had us create
              a blog. We could use whatever content we wanted to create but it
              had some criteria we had to accommodate and some challenges we had
              to overcome on our own like for example the comment section and
              the contact form post. We have had nothing about POST during this
              year so this was a challenge I am proud to say I solved. I also
              had a personal side goal to make this site fully scalable without
              a single line of media queries and I achieved that. My design on
              this project is fully scalable down to 320px and however big we
              want to go. I am working on a ultra wide monitor so that is what I
              used for testing.

              Hi Again! Like I started out saying, my name is Hans or in some
              circles more commonly known as Spookyrumble. I have been a gamer
              most of my life so as you probably guessed, Spookyrumble is my
              gamer name going back to the release of the XBox 360 when I
              started playing FPS games and I needed a tag. I occationally
              stream on Twitch under the same name and I am a part of many
              communities all over the world.
            </p>

            <p class="selfiePara">
              Personally I am a very calm and collected person. I work on a very
              logical level (to me) and I guess you can call me an observer and
              thinker more than a talker/speaker. I prefer to not take up to
              much space in a room but I will voice up if I feel the need and
              that is usually if I think someone could need help in some way.

              Most of my days are spent on my daughters. August 2023 they are
              all in school as my 5 year old starts 1st grade, which is nice.
              Taking this time right now to do these studies have been pure gold
              and I am in a very happy place. Biggest dream is to find some
              awesome collagues after I graduate so I can keep learning. I am
              enjoying development a lot as it speaks to my need to know how
              things work but also the arts and crafts it holds. There are
              barely any limits to what we can do!

            After having worked in the car industry more or less since 2003 with
            everything from the floor as a mechanic and car detailer to the
            parts department but mostly in the customer service department I
            found myself wanting to pursue a dream of doing something I found
            very interesting and fun. Like I said before, I have always been a
            gamer and very much interested in tech I wanted to go the IT way and
            started researching what branch I thought would suit me best.<br /><br />
            The choice landed on Front-End Development because it speaks to my
            natural qualities. I very much enjoy creating, troubleshooting and
            just making things work. I am one of those kids who picked apart my
            night stand radio just to see what it looked like inside. I am
            absolutely loving learning about development and working on these
            projects figuring out how to do what I want to do is so much fun and
            I feel like this is the perfect match for me. I am only sorry I did
            not start this sooner but while this waited I have had a long good
            life this far. Full of experience and my three wonderful daughters
            and my wife. May the rest of it be filled with awesome projects and
            creative people to work with!
