**Welcome to my portfolio, step in to my newfound world of development.**

My is name Hans aka Spookyrumble and I am a 40 year old student of the Front-End development craft. After 20+ years working a variety of jobs which includes everything from fisherman to coordinator I decided I wanted to pursue a long forgotten dream of development. Life and family kind of put everything in the back seat for a while but here I am and I couldn't be happier!

## Getting started

**All projects are stored on Github and Deployed with Netlify. It is as simple as clicking the link.**

- **The Cross-course Assignment: Rainydays** is the first design and development we did. It has followed us through the year and has been developed along as we went through the course modules.

  - [Visit website on Netlify](https://chic-lollipop-939ca8.netlify.app/)

- **The semester project: CSM** put together what we learned the first semester. The biggest difference with this project compared with the cross-course is that this was heavily text based while Rainydays is a ecommerce site.

* **Project Exam: Inside the trip** concludes our first year of studies. It brings together everything we have learned and then some as it holds som details we never learned but I was able to figure out and make work. Like the custom comment section and how to POST contact forms.
